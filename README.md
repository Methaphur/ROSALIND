# Solving Bioinformatic Problems on ROSALIND

This collection contains solutions to bioinformatics challenges hosted on the [ROSALIND]() platform. These problems are designed to teach computational biology concepts and techniques in a hands-on way, from basic string manipulations to advanced biological data analysis.

Each solution is implemented in Python and is designed to be simple, readable, and easy to understand for anyone with a basic programming background and an interest in bioinformatics.

(P.S - I am still working on this repository and will be adding more solutions in the future. Currently not solving any problems with tools or taking any algorithms for granted. I am trying to implement everything from scratch.)

## Table of Contents

1. [Bioinformatics Stronghold](./Bioinformatics%20Stronghold)
2. [Bioinformatics Armory](./Bioinformatics%20Armory)
3. [Bioinformatics Textbook Track](./Bioinformatics%20Textbook%20Track)


Each problem is organized into its respective directory based on its difficulty level. Navigate to the relevant directory and execute the Python script to view the solution.

## Input and Output

- Inputs for each problem are generally hardcoded in the scripts or provided as test files (if applicable).
- Outputs are printed directly to the console and, in some cases, saved to an output file for further analysis.

## Contributing

If you have a better solution to any of the problems or have a new problem to contribute, feel free to open a pull request. I am always open to learning new techniques and improving my code.
